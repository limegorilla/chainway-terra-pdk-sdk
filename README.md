# Terra/Chainway SDK implementation for Expo & React Native

This library implements the SDK provided by Terra/Chainway barcode scanners (my research suggests that one of them is a rebrand of the other) so that you can have native bindings for the scanner in your expo apps.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is working, but still needs some work before it can be a 1.0\
> All the working out should have been documented.

## Features
- [x] Scan and decode barcodes
- [x] Prepare and takeover scanner from other apps
- [ ] API for changing scanner settings

## Usage
